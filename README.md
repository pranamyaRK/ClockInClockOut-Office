# 🕒 Clock In, Clock Out: Office Life through CSS Art

My submission for the [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition sponsored by Axero, CSS Art: Office Culture](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero).

A project completed using pure HTML and CSS to recreate an office scene — no JavaScript. This project aims to bring the 9-to-5 life to your browser with interactive touches and playful animations.
